## Development ðŸ’»

Optional:

- If you want to get trending data from Twitter API, you need to create a Twitter developer account and get your API keys. Then add your API keys to `.env.development`. I hope Elon Musk doesn't make this API paid ðŸ˜….
- If you want to make the user stats synced with the deleted tweets, you need to enable the Cloud Functions for Firebase. Then deploy the Cloud Functions.
